# 2024_party_platform_word_cloud
Python code to generate word clouds for the 2024 Democratic &amp; Republican party platforms, which are provided as PDFs from the party platform websites. Word clouds are generated deterministically (i.e. random seed is fixed) with collocations enabled and word size directly proportional to frequency in the text (i.e. more frequent words will appear larger).
